Just a personal custom from [Anubis theme](https://github.com/Mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis). Please refer to the repo.

Some custom I did:
1. Switch social icon and light-dark switcher position.
2. Add [IntenseDebate](https://www.intensedebate.com/) simple code for comment service support.
3. Change date format from `2006-01-02` to `02 Jan 2006`. I wonder that there is a way to change the format to Indonesian language. Inspired by [this](https://michaelwelford.com/posts/hugo-tips-tricks).
4. Change the `post-info` position to before the post content.
5. Add last modification date. From [this](https://michaelwelford.com/posts/hugo-tips-tricks). I was in stuck until I read [this article](https://makewithhugo.com/add-a-last-edited-date/).
